		<h2>My hobbies</h2>
			<p>I have several hobbies such as watching movies, listening to musics, cooking, 
			and reading storybooks. But I enjoy having all of those hobbies, depending 
			on my location, mood, and weather condition. The most special one to me is 
			“reading storybooks”. <br><br>

			When I have some spare time, I enjoy reading storybooks because I think reading 
			gives us the ability to understand other people. However, I read both English and 
			Bengali books, but mostly it's a Bengali book that I find more interesting as I can 
			connect more with the writer and the story of course. My favorite author is Samaresh 
			Majumder. Although I didn't finish reading all his books, whatever I read I became 
			fond of his writings. There is a novel named "Shatkahon' which I read three times, 
			and surprisingly every time I read that book it felt like new.</p>

			<p>Watching movie is also my best way to spend my leisure time. Generally, I enjoy 
			watching thriller movies and crime shows but I don't mind watching other film genres if the story
			is awesome. Recently I have watched a movie named "Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle". It is a great movie and has become one of my favourite. Apart from these two things I also love to cook and experiment by making my own recipes. </p>
