		<h3>Why did you choose to study CSE?</h3>
			<p>I have chosen to study computer science because I am fascinated by 
			how computers work, and Iâ€™m hoping to pursue it as a career in the 
			future as well because computer science is quite popular in my 
			country as there is an increased demand for CS majors and the salaries 
			are very high. More generally, everything in our everyday life uses 
			computers, so there is a high demand for CS professionals.<br><br>

			Computer science is a dynamic and rapidly growing area that has become an essential
			part of the world that we live in today. I think, having a degree in this field will
			provide me with a deep understanding of theories and emerging technologies. </p>
